Analysis of the churn of the telecomunication company's clients using EDA and classic machine learning algorithms

Ð¡ustomer churn analysis using machine learning

Every business wants to maximize the number of customers. To achieve this goal, it is important not only to try to attract new ones, but also to retain existing ones. Retaining a customer is cheaper than acquiring a new one. In addition, a new client may turn out to be weakly interested in the services of the business and it will be difficult to work with him, while there is already the necessary data on interaction with the service about old clients.

Accordingly, by predicting the outflow, we can react in time and try to keep the client who wants to leave. Based on data about the services that the client uses, we can make him a special offer, trying to change his decision to leave the operator. This will make the task of retention easier to implement than the task of attracting new users that we don't know anything about yet.

Provided a dataset from a telecommunications company. The data contains information about almost six thousand users, their demographic characteristics, the services they use, the duration of using the operator's services, the method of payment, the amount of payment.

The task is to analyze the data and predict the outflow of users (to identify people who will renew the contract and who will not).

The work includes the following mandatory items:

Description of data (with calculation of basic statistics)
Study of dependencies and formulation of hypotheses
Building models for predicting outflow (with justification for choosing a particular model) based on tested hypotheses and identified relations
Comparison of the quality of the obtained models.
